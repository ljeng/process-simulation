Designing Without The Data 
Suppose you need to scale up a reactor to make a 
new drug ASAP. In order to avoid thermal runaway , 
you need to know the 
thermal properties  
of your reactants and 
products. 
You need heat capacities ,
but you don't have data at the right temperatures... 
(Very few chemicals have sufficient data)

A Typical Data Situation 
Product Reactant 
TrxnTinStirred-tank reactor 
No CP data at Tin or Trxn

Interpolation & Regression 
Interpolation  matches data exactly at each 
known point, but maybe not in between. 
Regression  
minimizes expected 
error overall - not an 
exact match at the 
known points, less 
risk of a big error. 
Interpolation 
Regression 
Which is better? 
Depends on the engineering problem The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art

Which is better? 
Depends on the engineering problem Think about the kinds of data that would make 
one method or another work better... The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Weierstrass theorem 
•For any continuous function f, there exists a 
polynomial P(x) with an error bound 𝜀:
What does this not guarantee? f(x)P(x)f(x)+ 𝜀
f(x)− 𝜀The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Weierstrass theorem traps 
•No bounds on the derivative  or curvature 
•No guarantee that the optima  are the same 
f(x)P(x)f(x)+ 𝜀
f(x)− 𝜀
Theorems are like contract lawyers 
We want a well-behaved polynomial The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Lagrange Polynomials 
•Say we want our polynomial to be exact at our 
data points, and have lowest possible degree 
•This is the definition of Lagrange Polynomials

Lagrange polynomial for 2 points 
Find the Lagrange polynomial for this data: 
x0, y0 = (1, 3), x1, y1 = (2, 3) 
With a weighted sum of 
these two lines, you can 
make any line! 3

Lagrange polynomial for 2 points 
Find the Lagrange polynomial for this data: 
x0, y0 = (1, 3), x1, y1 = (2, 3) 
(2 - x)  *  3      +  (x - 1)  *  3     =  3

Lagrange Polynomials for n > 1 
•What if we have 3, 5, 10, etc. data points? 
•Same procedure: values of f(xk) are the 
weights for the basis functions Ln,k(x)

Pn(x) has Bounded Error, but. . . 
We can bound the error in using Pn(x) to 
approximate f(x) ( Look familiar? ):
Not always helpful: the true f(x) is not known 
when we only have data, let alone a bound 
on its (n+1)th derivative. True

Problem: Runge’s Phenomenon 
•Lagrange gives higher-n 
polynomials for higher-n 
datasets 
•High-n polynomials have 
large derivatives ( Why? )
•Between datapoints, P(x) 
will oscillate (“ring”) 
•This can get really bad f(x)

Phenomenon 
How can we fit more points 
without higher-order polynomials? The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Piecewise Methods 
•Piecewise linear interpolation  – 
draw/calculate a line between adjacent 
data points to estimate an intermediate 
value – How many lines for n+1 points? 
•Simple 
•Robust 
•Any dataset size 
•No oscillation 
Any problems? The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Splines 
•Piecewise low-n polynomials fitted to 
match each datapoint and be smooth 
•Based on how an elastic piece of metal (a 
“spline”) physically curves between points 
Physical  
spline 
Mathematical  
spline The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
•Smooth  means that for each datapoint xi:
○P’i(xi)==P’i+1(xi)
○P’’i(xi)==P’’i+1(xi)
•Every cubic has 4 coefficients 
•Every point has x, f(x), P’(x), P’’(x) 
○Get P’, P’’ from f(xi+1) - f(xi) / (xi+1 - xi)
○Need to choose P’, P’’ at boundaries 
•Solve a linear system of equations to 
determine coefficients (Ax = b) Cubic splines The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Higher dimension interpolation 
•Example: heat capacity as a function of T 
and P (more dimensions: mixture ratio...) 
•Can use similar 
methods 
•Getting enough 
data is even harder 
•Regression helps 
•Difficult to visualize 
after 2-D 
The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Tools for interpolation 
•Spreadsheet  – trendlines on graphs are 
interpolation  if polynomial is order <= n for 
n+1 points, regression otherwise  (Ax = b) 
•Python  – numpy.polyfit, numpy.polyval 
(evaluates polynomial at point), 
scipy.interpolate.lagrange, 
scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline 
•Calculator  – never a bad idea to try a simple 
linear interpolation as a check 
•Brain  - nearest-neighbor is very fast! The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Interpolation Summary 
•You can always find a single polynomial of 
order n which fits any n+1 data points... 
○...But if n > 4, you should use a piecewise method 
•Lagrange (and similar methods) use one 
polynomial  for entire data set 
•You can use interpolation  methods to  
extrapolate , but expect problems ( Why? )
○Safer to use linear, not higher order ( Why? )
•We’ll see Lagrange’s Pn(x) again soon... The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art
