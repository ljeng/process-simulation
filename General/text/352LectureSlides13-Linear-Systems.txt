Linear Algebra 
•Vectors & matrices allow 
huge calculations to be 
represented with less 
code and logic 
•Linearity simplifies math 
•Because of this, decades 
of work have gone into 
framing every  problem 
as linear algebra The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Example: Stochastic Matrix 
A stochastic matrix (also called transition matrix or 
Markov matrix) summarizes the statistics of a 
complex system by saying: 
Given the current state, what is the probability of 
each possible next state? 
An example current state would be the current letter 
in a word, and the possible next states are all the 
letters that could follow it. The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art

THE WORLD ASSURANCE OF A MAN THIS WAS YOUR HUSBAND. Every pair of word-triplets has a probability

word-triplet "NEW LIGHTED", the model has directly

Motivation: Example PFD 
•What are R and S in this diagram? 
•What could xi represent? 
•What if there are yi, zi, wi, ..., what are those?

Set up the mole balance equations for this 
PFD, given that R & S operate so x3 = Rx2 and 
x6 + x7 = Sx4. Then arrange in the form Ax = b. Activity: Mole/Mass Balance 
The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Answer: Mole/Mass Balance 
Write out the equations with variables in order 
(x1, x2, x3, ...):
Expand into matrix form with each equation as 
a row (any absent variable = coefficient zero) 
-x1 + x2 - x5 = 0
-Rx2 + x3 = 0
x3 - x4 - x5 = 0
Sx4 - x6 - x7 = 0 The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
•How many degrees of freedom do we have? 
•What if the reactor equation is nonlinear?  
What about the separator? 
•How could we solve this linear system? Why 0? Answer: Mole/Mass Balance The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Gaussian Elimination for Ax = b 
•Want to reduce matrix to identity matrix 
•Three permissible row operations: 
1.Multiply equation/row by scalar 
2.Add scaled row to another equation/row 
3.Move rows/equations around 
•The pivot element  is the entry in A used to 
scale the row operations to remove variables 
•The number of operations for solving Ax = b is 
O(n3) if A has size n×n (that’s a lot for big n) 
•Does A have to be square? What rank? The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Gaussian Elimination Example 
How would you start turning 
matrix A into an identity matrix? 
(Remember, you have to do the 
same operations to b.) The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art

Example usage: cubic splines 
For datapoints y0, y1, etc, the cubic spline 
coefficients can be found by solving:

Matrix Pivoting Strategies 
•There are a combinatorial # of ways to do any 
given Gaussian elimination  - Why? 
•If the matrix A is ill-conditioned  (one variable is 
much smaller/bigger than the others) then it’s 
hard to find the exact solution due to round-off 
error (see p. 241 in F&B) 
•Methods such as partial pivoting , scaled partial  
pivoting , and total/full/maximal pivoting  can be 
used to reduce round-off error , using O(N3) 
extra flops ( Is that a lot in this context? )
•Iterative methods  (coming soon) are better... The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Linear algebra is easy in numpy 
b = np.array([ 1, 1, 1])  # Define vector b 
A = np.array([[ 4, -1, 1], [-1, 4.25, 2.75], 
[1, 2.75, 3.5]])  # Define matrix A 
x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)  # Find Ax = b 
C = A + B  # Find A plus B 
D = A @ B  # Find A times B (matrix multiply) 
E = A * B  # Find A times B COMPONENT-WISE 
Bsq = B** 2  # Square each element of B ( ≠B@B)
L = np.linalg.cholesky(A)  # Cholesky factor 
Ainv = np.linalg.inv(A)  # Inverse (unwise) 
Apnv = np.linalg.pinv(A)  # pseudo-inverse The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art
