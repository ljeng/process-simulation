Coding comfort: 10/10 
I want to learn more about biochemistry ●What is your name? 
●What are your pronouns? 
●Rate your comfort with coding (1-10) 
●Topic you haven’t learned yet as an engineer, but want to? The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Things I Would Like From You 
1.Bring problems to me ASAP 
○Especially if you feel unprepared 
○I might assume pre-reqs wrong 
2.Remind me about jargon 
○Some rare terms are common in my work 
○Raise your hand when I use them in class 
3.Be honest The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
In 16 months, you will have a degree 
that says “Chemical Engineering” on it 
1.What does that mean? 
2.What should you be able to do? 
3.How do numerical methods & process 
simulation fit in? The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
A familiar kind of problem 
What is the velocity profile v(r) of 
a viscous fluid flowing in a pipe? 
Assume radially symmetric, v=0 
at the edges, vmax is at center

Why not use existing software? 
•Whenever possible, you should! 
•But... The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Why not use existing software? 
•Whenever possible, you should! 
•But... 
•Numerical methods have hidden assumptions 
•All software has unknown bugs, especially 
technical software (narrow user base) 
•Software makers  are often more in demand 
than software users The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
What to expect from this class 
●~Weekly homework assignments 
●One midterm exam 
●One final project

participation 
30% 30% 30% 10%
●No more code than we need (but still a lot) 
●Tools: Python language, Kaggle & Google 
Colab notebooks The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Class materials 
●Most topics are in your textbooks 
●Topics that are part of the course, but NOT in 
the textbooks, are labeled “Supp:” on the 
syllabus 
○I will give you supplemental sources as 
needed 
●Bring a laptop or tablet to class which you are 
comfortable using to type code 
●If you have issues getting a textbook or laptop to 
use, let me know ASAP and I will help The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art

Coding environments 
●Behind the scenes: in previous years, this class 
has used a Python environment called Spyder 
○Spyder runs on your laptop 
○Each install is a little different 
○Usually that doesn't matter, but in this class 
we deal with error propagation

Previous software experience 
Show of hands: 
●Who has used Google Colab? 
●Who has used Kaggle? 
●Who has used Github? 
●Who has used Matlab (effectively)? 
Any other software experience that might 
be common among Cooper ChemEs? The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Coding with online notebooks 
●Google Colab & Kaggle are based on a popular 
Python environment called "Jupyter notebooks" 
●Can write plain code, or embed chunks of 
runnable code (called "cells") inside an 
interactive document 
●Code runs on the remote server, so everyone's 
environment can be identical 
○Used for machine learning competitions 
○Also great for this kind of class The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Set up Kaggle 
•Make a free account at kaggle.com 
•Send me your Kaggle handle via Teams 
–Mine is allaboutchemistry 
•Go to kaggle.com/learn/python 
The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Python warmup 
●We need a baseline of Python skills for the 
remainder of the course 
●I will provide class time and help to work on 
kaggle.com/learn/python  - today, next class, 
and at office hours 
●Graded by automated tests: you need all right 
answers, but the only penalty is to keep trying 
●Any parts you don't finish in class will become
