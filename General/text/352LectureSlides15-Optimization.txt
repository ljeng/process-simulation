Questions about pseudocode? 
•Follows the structure of code 
•Intended for human reading, not machine 
•Must be clear  and logically correct 
•No points off for simple syntax errors 
•Example: 
x = [0, 1, 2]  # comments help 
for i in range(0, len(x)): 
    print sign(x[i])  # eg +/- The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
The optimal topic to learn 
•Many problems in engineering (and life?) can 
be phrased as optimization: 
–Optimal conditions for a reactor 
–Optimal choice of reactor for a plant 
–Optimal plant for the world economy 
–Optimal studying for your GPA

Optimization formalism 
Optimization problems are typically stated as:

The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
•If Ω is all of Rn, then we have an unconstrained  
optimization problem : g(x) = h(x) = Ø (often we 
don’t even write the Ω for unconstrained) 
•If g(x) and/or h(x) are non-zero, then we have a 
constrained optimization problem 
•Most problems in engineering have constraints  
•There are tricks to turn constrained problems 
into unconstrained problems to solve them 
more easily What is constrained optimization? The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Multi-dimensional optimization 
•Typically more than one 
variable to optimize 
•Eg: why is this reactor 
this exact shape? 
•Make a geometric 
representation of the 
shape (many variables) 
•Optimize all variables 
together

Gradient-based optimization 
•If we have the gradient ∇f (x), we can optimize 
functions up to trillions  of variables 
•Without the gradient, even 100 is tough The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Defining the gradient 
•First derivative for a scalar function in n dims 
•Same shape ( n) as the input vector x 
•(What’s the derivative of a vector  function?)

Solve Linear Systems via Gradients 
•We can pose the solution to Ax = b as an  
optimization problem  of finding a vector   
r = Ax – b which is zero (if A is invertible) 
or with norm(r) as small as possible 
•We call r the residual vector :

Rearrange & simplify ||r|| ... 
What's "argmin"? The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Making an Equivalent Problem 
Since we don’t care what the actual value of 
the residual is, just where it is minimized, 
we can ignore the constant bTb: 
Let P = ATA
Let c = 2ATbThe Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Iterative optimizers 
•xk+1 is the next guess 
•xk is the current guess 
•dk is the search direction  (e.g. the gradient) 
•tk is the step siz eThe Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art

Method of Steepest Descent 
•The simplest gradient-based optimizer is 
steepest descent 
•Search direction = negative of gradient 
•This direction is guaranteed to be a descent  
direction  (f goes down, by definition) 
•Obviously effective: we go in the direction in 
which f goes down the fastest The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Molecule shape discovery 
•Preferred shape is near 
minimum energy ΔU 
(aka E) 
–Why just E not ΔG? 
–ΔG = ΔH - TΔS 
–ΔH = ΔU + PΔV 
–ΔG ≈ ΔH ≈ ΔU = E 
•Can calculate E( x) and 
∇E(x) with quantum 
mechanics 
•Given E( x) and ∇E(x), 
how can we find xmin?
The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art 
Follow the forces ⇨ ﬁnd xmin
•Coords vector x 
represents all atoms 
•Potential energy 
E(x) is a scalar 
• ∇E(x) has same 
dimensions as x
•Each component of -
∇E(x) is a force
